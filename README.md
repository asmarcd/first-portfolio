Project Description
I've created a basic portfolio site with three pages: an about me, a portfolio page, and a contact me page. It is mobile responsive and configured such that it can transition seamlessly between large, mid-size, and small screens or windows. 

Currently the contact me page does not function, but I plan to go back and add that functionality as I develop my skill set.
